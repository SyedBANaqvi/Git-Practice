Eventually with time I got a hang of it but with that came some neck twisting challenges too which initially was very overwhelming. But one thing I was always had in me was never to be scared. With time I saw successes and failures all of which kept adding to my experience as a film director. \nAnother thing that grew on me over time is realizing that creative professions are always more interesting and keep you committed in a better way compared to fields like engineering or medical where you have to keep you head inside a book at all times. Academic years in an art program makes you learn more about life too. Everything adds to your perspective; the experience is wholesome. I have had friends in engineering and medical always complaining about being stuck on some numerical and crying about syllabus and books that they had to memorize word by word while my job was only to create something of my own that stands out which I always found more fulfilling. \nWith time I met people that needed my service as an animator and from there I started a gig for 2D and 3D animation and I did plenty of animation tasks that I enjoyed doing. All of which added to my knowledge and experience. I worked with multiple website tasks, freelancing and worked on some local projects too which was productive. But it was my thesis film that depend my connection with my work. I worked day and night editing, shooting, reshooting, rewriting script. Those days of grinding payed off too and I realized that this is what I want to do with my time and energy. \nUnderstanding the film medium, its language and mode of work was challenging but now that I am well aware of it, it settled in me and I realized my inclination towards animation and editing. I am recently employed at a content creating firm too. I work there as a video editor and animator and I don’t feel tired. I realized I am always more concerned about getting my work done in time rather that worrying how much work it is or if I can do it or not. Sometimes I stay extra hours without even noticing and it is funny how time passes faster when you do something you enjoy. \nI want to get enrolled in masters because even though I know a lot about multimedia, there is still a lot that I don’t know and I have always been an explorer. Therefore, I wouldn’t miss any opportunity on learning more and growing more as a film maker and as a person.  \n\n",
